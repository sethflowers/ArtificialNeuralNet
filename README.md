    In computer science and related fields, artificial neural networks are models 
    inspired by animal central nervous systems (in particular the brain) that are 
    capable of machine learning and pattern recognition. They are usually presented 
    as systems of interconnected "neurons" that can compute values 
    from inputs by feeding information through the network.
